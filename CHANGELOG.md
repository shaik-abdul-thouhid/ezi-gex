# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

<!-- On tagging the first release, rename the `## [Unreleased]` section below to
     `## [0.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD` and start a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]`. -->

## [Unreleased]

First public surface (the **0.1.0** line). Everything here is annotated
`@stable-since: v0.1.0` in the source and is covered by SemVer from the tag on.

### Added

- **Pipeline:** `pattern → AST → HIR → Program → match`, runnable at **runtime**
  (heap) and **comptime** (ro_data) from one code path.
- **Front door** (`engine/regex.zig`): `compileRuntime` / `compileComptime` and
  their `*With(Backend, …)` variants returning a backend-parametric `Compiled`,
  with `isMatch` / `find` / `captures` / `findAll` / `capturesAll` / `count` /
  `split` / `replaceAll`, plus `isMatchComptime` / `findComptime` / `countComptime`.
- **Backend contract** (`engine/backend.zig`): a duck-typed, vtable-free `type`
  contract (`caps`, `Program`, `Scratch`, build + search primitives), the
  `Engine(Backend)` agnostic operation layer (every iterator/capture/replace op
  implemented once, generically), `verifyBackend`, and the optional `Cell`/`Carver`
  comptime-friendly scratch convention.
- **Backends:** `pikevm` (Pike VM, captures, linear-time), `backtrack` (bounded
  backtracker, memoized, linear-time), `literal` (stateless substring /
  literal-alternation), and `auto` (the default dispatcher: literal-vs-NFA at
  build, backtrack-vs-pikevm per input). All build and run at comptime and runtime.
- **Frontend** (`core/`): storage-agnostic scanner (single-pass, explicit-stack,
  no recursion), flat AST, an `error.zig` diagnostic catalogue (precise code + byte
  span; unsupportable constructs are *rejected*, not mis-parsed), and the **HIR**
  builder — applies/drops flags, resolves all Unicode (`\d \w \s`, `\p{…}`/`\P{…}`,
  scripts, classes) to sorted/merged/negation-applied code-point ranges via
  `ezi_code` range tables, simple case folding, simplification, and a sound
  prefilter/length `Analysis`.
- **Unicode:** code-point-based matching with zero match-time Unicode-table
  lookups for classes; `\p{}`/`\P{}` general categories, groups, derived
  properties, and scripts; Unicode-aware `\w`/`\b`; simple case folding under `(?i)`.
- **Errors as data:** `Diagnostic` (code + span + message + caret renderer);
  runtime `parse` returns `error.InvalidPattern` and never crashes on bad input;
  comptime `compile` turns a bad pattern into a located `@compileError`.

### Notes & known limitations (intentional for 0.1.0)

- **No backreferences, lookaround, atomic/conditional groups, recursion, or
  `\Q…\E`.** A Thompson NFA cannot express them; each is rejected with a specific
  error code (same scope as RE2 / Go `regexp` / Rust `regex`).
- **Anchors are JS/RE2-style:** `$` (without `m`) means end-of-input (`\z`), not
  "before a trailing newline"; `\Z` is treated as `\z`.
- **`\X` (grapheme cluster)** parses but no current backend executes it — such a
  pattern fails at build with `error.Unsupported` (`caps.grapheme = false`).
- **`case_fold = .full`** currently behaves like `.simple` (the 1→many fold,
  e.g. `ß` → `ss`, is not yet implemented). `Script_Extensions` falls back to the
  plain `Script` ranges.
- **`{m,n}` is not size-capped yet** — a huge counted repeat expands to a large
  program (bounded by allocation / the comptime branch quota, never UB).
- **Performance is unoptimized:** the prefilter `Analysis` is computed but not yet
  consumed by any backend, the literal scan is naive (no `memchr`), and there is no
  lazy-DFA backend. See `docs/architecture.md` for the planned tiers.
