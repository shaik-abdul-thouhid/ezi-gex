## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-07

First public surface and first tagged release. Everything here is annotated
`@stable-since: v0.1.0` in the source and is covered by SemVer from this tag on.

### Added

- **Pipeline:** `pattern → AST → HIR → Program → match`, runnable at **runtime**
  (heap) and **comptime** (ro_data) from one code path.
- **Front door** (`engine/regex.zig`): `compileRuntime` / `compileComptime` and
  their `*With(Backend, …)` variants returning a backend-parametric `Compiled`,
  with `isMatch` / `find` / `captures` / `findAll` / `capturesAll` / `count` /
  `split` / `replaceAll`, plus `isMatchComptime` / `findComptime` / `countComptime`.
- **Backend contract** (`engine/backend.zig`): a duck-typed, vtable-free `type`
  contract (`caps`, `Program`, `Scratch`, build + search primitives), the
  `Engine(Backend)` agnostic operation layer (every iterator/capture/replace op
  implemented once, generically), `verifyBackend`, and the optional `Cell`/`Carver`
  comptime-friendly scratch convention.
- **Backends:** `pikevm` (Pike VM, captures, linear-time), `backtrack` (bounded
  backtracker, memoized, linear-time), `literal` (stateless substring /
  literal-alternation), and `auto` (the default dispatcher: literal-vs-NFA at
  build, backtrack-vs-pikevm per input). All build and run at comptime and runtime.
- **Tier-1 prefilter (literal + `auto`):** the `literal` backend scans with
  `std.mem.indexOf` (SIMD `memchr` for one-byte needles, Boyer–Moore–Horspool with a
  skip table otherwise) instead of an `eql` at every position — ~20× on
  memchr-friendly needles, never slower. `auto` now consumes the HIR `Analysis` on the
  NFA arm: a leading-literal first-byte `memchr` prefilter (anchored-confirm at each
  hit), a `^`/`\A` start short-circuit, and a `min_utf8_len` length gate — all sound
  one-sided bounds, so no real match is ever dropped. Works at comptime and runtime.
- **Target-agnostic library:** the importable surface (`src/root.zig`) is pure
  computation over caller-provided memory — no syscalls, allocator globals, or
  platform assumptions — and is verified to compile for `wasm32-freestanding`,
  `wasm32-wasi`, `riscv64-freestanding`, and `aarch64-linux`.
- **Frontend** (`core/`): storage-agnostic scanner (single-pass, explicit-stack,
  no recursion), flat AST, an `error.zig` diagnostic catalogue (precise code + byte
  span; unsupportable constructs are *rejected*, not mis-parsed), and the **HIR**
  builder — applies/drops flags, resolves all Unicode (`\d \w \s`, `\p{…}`/`\P{…}`,
  scripts, classes) to sorted/merged/negation-applied code-point ranges via
  `ezi_code` range tables, simple case folding, simplification, and a sound
  prefilter/length `Analysis`.
- **Unicode:** code-point-based matching with zero match-time Unicode-table
  lookups for classes; `\p{}`/`\P{}` general categories, groups, derived
  properties, and scripts; Unicode-aware `\w`/`\b`; simple case folding under `(?i)`.
- **Errors as data:** `Diagnostic` (code + span + message + caret renderer);
  runtime `parse` returns `error.InvalidPattern` and never crashes on bad input;
  comptime `compile` turns a bad pattern into a located `@compileError`.

### Notes & known limitations (intentional for 0.1.0)

- **No backreferences, lookaround, atomic/conditional groups, recursion, or
  `\Q…\E`.** A Thompson NFA cannot express them; each is rejected with a specific
  error code (same scope as RE2 / Go `regexp` / Rust `regex`).
- **Anchors are JS/RE2-style:** `$` (without `m`) means end-of-input (`\z`), not
  "before a trailing newline"; `\Z` is treated as `\z`.
- **`\X` (grapheme cluster)** parses but no current backend executes it — such a
  pattern fails at build with `error.Unsupported` (`caps.grapheme = false`).
- **`case_fold = .full`** currently behaves like `.simple` (the 1→many fold,
  e.g. `ß` → `ss`, is not yet implemented). `Script_Extensions` falls back to the
  plain `Script` ranges.
- **`{m,n}` is not size-capped yet** — a huge counted repeat expands to a large
  program (bounded by allocation / the comptime branch quota, never UB).
- **No lazy-DFA backend yet.** Tier-1 (the literal/prefilter fast path) is wired, but
  on general (non-prefixable) patterns throughput is still NFA-simulation-bound and
  below RE2/Rust. A one-pass capture path and a runtime-only lazy DFA are the next,
  additive tiers — the backend contract is the seam for both. See
  `docs/architecture.md` for the planned tiers.
